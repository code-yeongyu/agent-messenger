Agent Skills are instruction files that teach AI coding agents how to use tools effectively. Agent Messenger includes skills for Slack, Discord, and Teams.

## What Are Agent Skills?

When you give an AI agent access to a CLI tool, it needs to know:
- What commands are available
- How to format arguments
- What output to expect
- Best practices and common patterns

Agent Skills provide this knowledge in a structured format that AI agents can understand.

## Installation

### Skills CLI

The fastest way to add Agent Messenger skills to your project:

```bash
npx skills add devxoul/agent-messenger
```

This adds the skill files to your project's `.skills/` directory.

### Claude Code

Add Agent Messenger skills to Claude Code:

```bash
# From terminal
claude plugin marketplace add devxoul/agent-messenger
claude plugin install agent-messenger
```

Or from within Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add devxoul/agent-messenger
/plugin install agent-messenger
```

### OpenCode

Add to your `opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    "agent-messenger@1.1.0"
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

Once installed, your AI agent can:

1. **Understand the CLI** - Know what commands exist and how to use them
2. **Extract credentials** - Run `agent-slack auth extract` automatically
3. **Send messages** - Compose and send messages on your behalf
4. **Read context** - Get workspace snapshots to understand conversations
5. **React appropriately** - Add reactions, reply in threads, etc.

## Example Interaction

With Agent Messenger skills installed, you can ask your AI agent:

> "Send a message to #general saying the build passed"

The agent will:
1. Check if credentials are configured
2. Run `agent-slack auth extract` if needed
3. Execute `agent-slack message send general "The build passed"`
4. Confirm the message was sent
