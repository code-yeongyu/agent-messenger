Agent Messenger is a unified, agent-friendly CLI for messaging platforms. It automatically extracts credentials from your desktop apps—no OAuth flows, no API keys, no admin approval needed.

## Why Agent Messenger?

### For AI Agents

AI agents need to communicate with humans through messaging platforms. But integrating with Slack, Discord, or Teams traditionally requires:

- **OAuth setup** - Creating apps, getting admin approval, managing tokens
- **API keys** - Storing secrets, handling rotation, security concerns
- **Platform-specific code** - Learning different APIs for each platform

Agent Messenger eliminates all of this. Your agent can start sending messages in seconds.

### For Developers

Building AI-powered workflows that interact with messaging platforms shouldn't require a week of OAuth debugging. Agent Messenger provides:

- **Zero configuration** - Extract tokens from your existing desktop apps
- **Unified interface** - Same commands work across all platforms
- **JSON output** - Perfect for piping into other tools or LLMs

## How It Works

Agent Messenger reads authentication tokens directly from your installed desktop apps (Slack, Discord, Teams). These apps store session tokens locally, and Agent Messenger safely extracts them.

```bash
# Extract credentials from Slack desktop app
agent-slack auth extract

# That's it! Now you can send messages
agent-slack message send general "Hello from my AI agent!"
```

No app creation. No admin approval. No waiting.
