## Quick Start

Get up and running in 30 seconds:

```bash
# 1. Extract credentials from your Slack desktop app
agent-slack auth extract

# 2. See your workspace at a glance
agent-slack snapshot --pretty

# 3. Send a message
agent-slack message send general "Hello from the CLI!"
```

That's it. No OAuth flows. No API tokens. No configuration files.
