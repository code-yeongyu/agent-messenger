## Installation

```bash
npm install -g agent-messenger
```

Or use your favorite package manager:

```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm add -g agent-messenger

# Using yarn
yarn global add agent-messenger

# Using bun
bun add -g agent-messenger
```

This installs three CLI tools:
- `agent-slack` — Slack CLI
- `agent-discord` — Discord CLI
- `agent-teams` — Microsoft Teams CLI

## Extract Credentials

Agent Messenger automatically extracts tokens from your desktop apps. Make sure the app is installed and you're logged in.

```bash
# For Slack
agent-slack auth extract

# For Discord
agent-discord auth extract

# For Teams
agent-teams auth extract
```

That's it. No OAuth flows. No API tokens. No configuration files.

## Verify Setup

Check that authentication worked:

```bash
agent-slack auth status
```

You should see your workspace name and user info.

## Send Your First Message

```bash
# Get a snapshot of your workspace
agent-slack snapshot --pretty

# Send a message to a channel
agent-slack message send general "Hello from the CLI!"
```

## Output Formats

By default, all commands output compact JSON (perfect for AI agents):

```bash
agent-slack channel list
# {"channels":[{"id":"C01234567","name":"general",...}]}
```

Add `--pretty` for human-readable output:

```bash
agent-slack channel list --pretty
```

## Multi-Workspace Support

If you're logged into multiple workspaces:

```bash
# List all workspaces
agent-slack workspace list

# Switch to a different workspace
agent-slack workspace switch <workspace-id>

# Check current workspace
agent-slack workspace current
```
