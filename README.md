# Agent Messenger

**Give your AI agent the power to read and send messages across Slack, Discord, Teams and more**

A unified, agent-friendly CLI for messaging platforms. Zero-config credential extraction from your desktop apps—no OAuth flows, no API keys, no admin approval needed. Works out of the box.

## Why Agent Messenger?

- **No API keys needed** — Automatically extracts credentials from your installed desktop apps
- **One interface, multiple platforms** — Learn once, use everywhere (Slack, Discord, Teams)
- **AI-agent friendly** — JSON output by default, perfect for LLM tool use
- **Human friendly too** — Add `--pretty` for readable output

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g agent-messenger
```

Or use your favorite package manager.

This installs:
- `agent-slack` — Slack CLI
- `agent-discord` — Discord CLI

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 30 seconds:

```bash
# 1. Extract credentials from your Slack desktop app
agent-slack auth extract

# 2. See your workspace at a glance
agent-slack snapshot --pretty

# 3. Send a message
agent-slack message send general "Hello from the CLI!"
```

That's it. No OAuth flows. No API tokens. No configuration files.

## Philosophy

**Why not MCP?** MCP servers expose all tools at once, bloating context and confusing agents. **[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) + agent-friendly CLI** offer a better approach—load what you need, when you need it. Fewer tokens, cleaner context, better output.

**Why not OAuth?** OAuth requires an app and it requires workspace admin approval to install, which can take days. This tool just works—zero setup required. Bot support is on the roadmap for those who prefer it.
