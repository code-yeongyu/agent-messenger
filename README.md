**Give your AI agent the power to read and send messages across Slack, Discord, Teams and more**

A unified, agent-friendly CLI for messaging platforms. Zero-config credential extraction from your desktop apps—no OAuth flows, no API keys, no admin approval needed. Works out of the box.

## Why Agent Messenger?

Messaging platforms like Slack, Discord, and Teams only offer Bot tokens for API access. This means your AI agent can never act **as you**—it can only act as a bot. Agent Messenger changes this by extracting user credentials directly from your installed desktop apps, letting your agent send messages, react, and interact on your behalf. Of course, it fully supports bot tokens too for server-side and CI/CD use cases.

- **Act as yourself, not a bot** — Extracted user tokens let your agent operate on your behalf
- **No API keys needed** — Automatically extracts credentials from your installed desktop apps
- **One interface, multiple platforms** — Learn once, use everywhere (Slack, Discord, Teams)
- **AI-agent friendly** — JSON output by default, perfect for LLM tool use
- **Human friendly too** — Add `--pretty` for readable output
- **Token efficient** — CLI, not MCP. Load only what you need. ([Why not MCP?](#philosophy))

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g agent-messenger
```

Or use your favorite package manager.

This installs:
- `agent-slack` — Slack CLI (user token, zero-config)
- `agent-slackbot` — Slack Bot CLI (bot token, for server-side/CI/CD)
- `agent-discord` — Discord CLI
- `agent-teams` — Microsoft Teams CLI

## Agent Skills

Agent Messenger includes [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) that teach your AI agent how to use these CLIs effectively.

### Skills CLI

```bash
npx skills add devxoul/agent-messenger
```

See [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) for more details.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add devxoul/agent-messenger
claude plugin install agent-messenger
```

Or within Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add devxoul/agent-messenger
/plugin install agent-messenger
```

### OpenCode

Add to your `opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    "agent-messenger@1.3.0"
  ]
}
```

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 30 seconds:

```bash
# 1. Extract credentials from your Slack desktop app
agent-slack auth extract

# 2. See your workspace at a glance
agent-slack snapshot --pretty

# 3. Send a message
agent-slack message send general "Hello from the CLI!"
```

That's it. No OAuth flows. No API tokens. No configuration files.

## Philosophy

**Why not MCP?** MCP servers expose all tools at once, bloating context and confusing agents. **[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) + agent-friendly CLI** offer a better approach—load what you need, when you need it. Fewer tokens, cleaner context, better output.

**Why not OAuth?** OAuth requires an app and it requires workspace admin approval to install, which can take days. This tool just works—zero setup required. For those who prefer bot tokens (e.g., server-side or CI/CD), see [`agent-slackbot`](docs/slackbot.md).
