**Give your AI agent the power to read and send messages across Slack, Discord, Teams and more**

A unified, agent-friendly CLI for messaging platforms. Zero-config credential extraction from your desktop apps—no OAuth flows, no API keys, no admin approval needed. Works out of the box.

## 🤔 Why Agent Messenger?

Messaging platforms only offer Bot tokens for API access—your AI agent can never act **as you**. Agent Messenger extracts user credentials directly from your installed desktop apps, letting your agent operate on your behalf. Bot tokens are fully supported too for server-side and CI/CD use cases.

- 🎭 **Act as yourself, not a bot** — Extracted user tokens let your agent operate on your behalf
- 🔑 **No API keys needed** — Automatically extracts credentials from your installed desktop apps
- 🌐 **One interface, multiple platforms** — Learn once, use everywhere (Slack, Discord, Teams)
- 🤖 **AI-agent friendly** — JSON output by default, perfect for LLM tool use
- 👤 **Human friendly too** — Add `--pretty` for readable output
- ⚡ **Token efficient** — CLI, not MCP. Load only what you need. ([Why not MCP?](#philosophy))

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g agent-messenger
```

Or use your favorite package manager.

This installs:
- `agent-slack` — Slack CLI (user token, zero-config)
- `agent-slackbot` — Slack Bot CLI (bot token, for server-side/CI/CD)
- `agent-discord` — Discord CLI
- `agent-teams` — Microsoft Teams CLI

## 🧠 Agent Skills

Agent Messenger includes [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) that teach your AI agent how to use these CLIs effectively. Install the skill for your platform:

### Skills CLI (OpenCode, Cline, etc.)

```bash
npx skills add devxoul/agent-messenger
```

See [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) for more details.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add devxoul/agent-messenger
claude plugin install agent-messenger
```

Or within Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add devxoul/agent-messenger
/plugin install agent-messenger
```

### OpenCode (via plugin)

Add to your `opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    "agent-messenger"
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in 30 seconds:

```bash

## 💭 Philosophy

**Why not MCP?** MCP servers expose all tools at once, bloating context and confusing agents. **[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) + agent-friendly CLI** offer a better approach—load what you need, when you need it. Fewer tokens, cleaner context, better output.

**Why not OAuth?** OAuth requires an app and it requires workspace admin approval to install, which can take days. This tool just works—zero setup required. For those who prefer bot tokens (e.g., server-side or CI/CD), see [`agent-slackbot`](skills/agent-slackbot/SKILL.md).
